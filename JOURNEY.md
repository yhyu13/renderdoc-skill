# JOURNEY — RenderDoc Agent Verification & Fix Harness

> Project history in two-column form. **Me** = the human driving; **You** = Kilo (the agent).
> Started 2026-08-18. This journey spans two repos: the three spec documents live in
> `renderdoc-skill/`, and the implementation landed in `RenderDocMCP/rdc_harness/`.

## The spec documents (requirements)

- `renderdoc-agent-interview-guide.md` — token funnel, MCP-vs-Skill split, anomaly rules, SAM chunking, semi-transparent particles.
- `renderdoc-AI-Agent-token高效指南.md` — Layer1/Layer2/Resource summaries, auto-red-flags, early-stop.
- `renderdoc-perception-agent-design.md` — L1 deterministic + L2 behavioral verification, shader edit/replay loop, fix report.

## Two-column log

| Me | You |
|---|---|
| Handed the 3 spec docs and asked: do `renderdoc-skill/` and `RenderDocMCP/` meet them? Then (1) plan the gap closure + double-check best practice, (2) execute + build, (3) self-critic + improve. "Long task, set goals." | Read all 3 docs and both repos end-to-end. Gap analysis: both repos expose only MCP **data-access** tools; all 3 docs converge on a missing **orchestrator + double-layer (L1/L2) verification + report** glue, plus an auto-red-flags rule engine (Doc2 §10.2, Doc1 §2.2, Doc3 §3). |
| — | Proposed the plan: build a pure-Python, RenderDoc-agnostic `rdc_harness/` in `RenderDocMCP`. Rationale: `renderdoc` module isn't installed here → the logic must be GPU-free and unit-testable; Doc3 §3.3 mandates "deterministic checks before model" (zero-model rules). RenderDoc I/O sits behind `ShaderBackend`/`ShaderPatcher` protocols. |
| — | Built `rdc_harness/` (`models` / `rules` / `behavioral` / `summarize` / `orchestrator` / `report`) + 5 test files. Fixed two test-fixture bugs (bottleneck fixture was actually 57% pixel-shader; orchestrator returns the *final* patched source, not the original). 40 tests green. |
| — | Self-critic round 1: added numpy fast path to `pixel_diff`/`psnr` (with pure-Python fallback + parity test), fixed `score_from_report` no-signal→1.0 so "unverifiable" can't read as "converged", removed unused imports. 40 tests + end-to-end demo. |
| Critic #1 (P0/P1/P2): wheel `packages` excludes `rdc_harness`; no process-placement note (must not import from RenderDoc's Python 3.6 extension); `rt_hash` copies the buffer; `run_behavioral` no short-circuit on hash mismatch; `rule_bandwidth` + `check_min_lod` false-PASS on missing data; `report.py` untested; orchestrator boundary untested; no test runner/CLI. | Fixed all: added `rdc_harness` to wheel packages, `__init__` process note, zero-copy `rt_hash`, hash-mismatch short-circuit, bandwidth/min_lod guards (this caught a real `None`-append bug in `run_deterministic`), `test_report.py`, `max_round=0` + history-content tests, `ShaderPatcher.patch` contract, `__main__.py` CLI with `utf-8-sig` BOM handling, `test_cli.py`. 57 tests green. |
| Accepted `/review uncommitted`. | Ran the review: spawned 6 parallel track sub-agents (security / performance / business logic / deploy safety / duplication / dead code) → 9 findings (5 WARNING + 4 SUGGESTION). Recommendation: NEEDS CHANGES. |
| Critic #2: confirmed all 9 findings, added one more (`rule_setpass_rt` missing-data shape), gave a recommended fix order. | Implemented in order: `OverflowError` catch in `_num`; `pass_threshold` default 0.05→0.01 (WARN boundary); SKIP emission for the 8 frame-level rules + non-vacuous `all_pass()`; single-pass `_compute_stats` (int16 diff + int32 squares — no float64, no duplicate full passes, no `bytes()` copies); status-based `threshold_verdict`; `_result` dedup (imported from `rules`); removed unused imports. 63 tests green. |
| Critic #3: verified 8/8 fixes against source; flagged "why 1.0 by default" in `score_from_report` as worth a comment. | Pointed out the `score_from_report` docstring already documents it ("no pixel-diff evidence → 1.0 so the orchestrator never mistakes 'unverifiable' for 'converged'"); kept the *semantic* sentinel question deferred to P3. |
| Acknowledged ("Critic closed.") and asked to dump this `JOURNEY.md`. | Wrote it to both repos. |
| We have `rdc_harness` but the RenderDoc-side I/O is all `NotImplementedError`. "Can we wire it up?" | Verified doc3 §4.3 against the RenderDoc v1.45 Python API reference: `SetShaderBytes` / `ReplayEvent` **do not exist** in the bindings. Real flow: `BuildTargetShader(entry, enc, source, flags, stage) → (ResourceId, messages)` → `ReplaceResource(original, compiled)` → `SetFrameEvent(eventId, force=True)`; `RemoveReplacement` reverts. |
| — | Adapted `ShaderBackend` (`compile_shader → bytes` → `→ str` handle) and added the missing glue: `ShaderEditService` (compile / replace / replay / remove / debug-messages / get-source) + 6 new MCP tools + facade/request-handler wiring; filled `RenderDocShaderBackend` bodies (bridge-driven `run_l1`/`run_l2`). 71 tests green. |
| Accepted `/review uncommitted`. | Review: 5 findings (1 WARNING + 4 SUGGESTION) — L2 assumes RGBA8; `get_shader_source` returns binary not editable source; double replay per round; `run_l1` omitted `GetDebugMessages`; dead `_stage`. |
| "Fix all issues." | Fixed: L2 format/size guards; `is_source_text` flag + clarified docs; `replace_shader` force=False; new `check_validation_messages` rule + `run_deterministic(debug_messages=...)`; removed dead `_stage`. 74 tests green. |
| "git add + push", then "README → 中文, update what we did, update JOURNEY, push." | Committed `c179423` + pushed `origin/main`; translated README to Chinese (new tools + loop + `rdc_harness`); updated JOURNEY in both repos. |

## Final state

- **Deliverable**: `RenderDocMCP/rdc_harness/` — a RenderDoc-agnostic, GPU-free, unit-tested verification + shader-fix orchestrator core, now backed by a bridge-driven `RenderDocShaderBackend` and a `ShaderEditService` on the extension side (the RenderDoc-side I/O is wired end-to-end).
- **Coverage**: Doc1 (token funnel + MCP/Skill split + anomaly rules), Doc2 (Layer1/Layer2 summaries + `auto_red_flags`), Doc3 (L1 deterministic + L2 behavioral + shader edit/replay loop + fix report).
- **Tests**: 74/74 pass (`python -m unittest discover -s tests`), `py_compile` clean.
- **Deferred (P3)**: `check_binding_completeness` docstring drift; `score_from_report` no-signal sentinel *semantics*; `rule_setpass_rt` missing-data shape; `ShaderCompileFlags` default (`rd.ShaderCompileFlags()` vs int) unverified against a real binding.
- **Future work**: run the full loop against a real RenderDoc/GPU to validate `BuildTargetShader` / `ReplaceResource` / `SetFrameEvent`; golden-baseline management (doc3 open question); `get_debug_messages` queue-draining semantics.

## WebGPU capture support (2026-08-18)

> A second workstream: the skill (`renderdoc-skill`) covered post-capture *inspection*, but the
> **capture side** of `renderdoc-webgpu.md` (§1/§1a) and the `12_ddgi` recipe (§2) were missing
> from both repos, along with any WebGPU/Dawn knowledge.

| Me | You |
|---|---|
| Reviewed `renderdoc-webgpu.md` against both repos and ruled: both cover only the inspect half; Chrome D3D12 process-injection capture, Dawn flags, and the `12_ddgi` recipe are all missing. Handed over an update plan. | Executed: `renderdoc-skill` gained `references/webgpu-capture.md` (port of §1/§1a/caveats, Windows-only) and `capture_webgpu.py` (launch Chrome → parse GPU-dialog PID → `rd.InjectIntoProcess` → collect `.rdc`); `debugging-recipes.md` gained Recipe 7 (`12_ddgi`); `SKILL.md` gained WebGPU/WebGL/Chrome/Dawn/three.js trigger words + a §2 "WebGPU / WebGL (browser)" subsection. `RenderDocMCP` got a one-line WebGPU(D3D12) compatibility note — no capture added (the extension runs in RenderDoc's Python 3.6 sandbox and can't drive Chrome). |
| — | Verified: `capture_webgpu.py` `py_compile` clean; `RenderDocMCP` 63 tests green. Left `rdc doctor` + a real `capture_webgpu.py` run for a host with Chrome Canary v144+ + RenderDoc. |
| "git add files and push to remote" | Committed + pushed both repos (`renderdoc-skill` master `10c48db`; `RenderDocMCP` main `cd04063`). |
| "更新readme成中文，更新我们所做，更新journey然后push to remote" | Translated `renderdoc-skill/README.md` to Chinese (WebGPU section + 7 recipes + file structure); restored the Chinese WebGPU note in `RenderDocMCP/README.md`; appended this section to both JOURNEYs; pushed. |

### Deliverables

- `renderdoc-skill`: `references/webgpu-capture.md` (new), `capture_webgpu.py` (new), `debugging-recipes.md` Recipe 7, `SKILL.md` trigger/scope/§2 updates.
- `RenderDocMCP`: README WebGPU(D3D12) compatibility note (docs only).

### Status

- Pushed both repos (see commits above).
- Pending manual verification: `rdc doctor` + `capture_webgpu.py` against `12_ddgi`, confirming the `.rdc` exposes named `ddgi_probeData` / `ddgi_rayDir` resources (needs Chrome Canary v144+ + RenderDoc).
